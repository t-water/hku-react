# Introduction

This is the repository I kept for Hong Kong University of Science and Technology's Coursera Course on React.js found [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/front-end-react). In the process of auditing this course, I built a considerable knowledge base concerning Single Page Applications, as well as the specific guiding principles of React's component based architecture. I applied these skills in the creation of https://chessarchive.org, which was bootstrapped using create-react-app.
